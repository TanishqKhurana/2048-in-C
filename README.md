INTRODUCTION
The 2048 game is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game where players combine tiles with the same numerical value to create tiles with higher values. The game's objective is to reach the elusive 2048 tile, a challenging feat that requires strategic thinking and planning. In this project, we aim to develop a C program that simulates the 2048 game, allowing players to play and experience the game on the command line.

Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is to create an engaging and entertaining implementation of the 2048 game in C, providing users with an opportunity to enjoy this classic puzzle game on a text-based interface.

Problem Statement
The problem in this project is the development of a C program that accurately emulates the 2048 game. This program should enable players to play the game, make moves, combine tiles, track their score, and determine whether they have successfully reached the 2048 tile.



Methodology:
1. Design the game board: Create a data structure to represent the game board and initialize it with two random tiles.
2. Implement game logic: Develop the core game logic to handle user moves, tile merging, and game state.
3. User input and output: Implement functions to read user input and display the game board.
4. Game loop: Create a game loop that continuously accepts user input, updates the game state, and checks for a win or loss condition.
5. Score tracking: Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's progress.
6. Endgame conditions: Define the conditions for winning and losing the game.
7. Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation for users to understand how to play the game.
